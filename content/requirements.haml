%h2 Requirements

%p
  Before installing the script, the StackFu engine can perform some checks 
  on the environment to make sure the system meets the preconditions 
  specified in the Requirements section.

%p
  The requirements descriptor file has the following format:

%pre
  %code
    :preserve
      --- 
      requirements: 
      - data: /usr/bin/apt-get
        type: ExecutableExists
      - data: /var/data/some_file.dat
        type: FileExists

%p
  Each entry has a `type` and `data` field. In the example, two checks will be 
  performed: that the file `/usr/bin/apt-get` exists and is executable and the the 
  file `/var/data/some_file.dat` also exists.

%p Here are the types of checks the engine can perform:

<%= table(
	:headers => ["Type", "Will assure"],
	:contents => <<-EOS
  FileExists    | that the given file exists			     
  SymlinkExists | that the given symlink exists            
  ExecutableExists    | that the given file exists and is executable
  DirExists     | that the given directory exits           
  ProcessExists | that the process is runnning             
  RubyCanLoad   | that ruby can load a given lib      
  RubyGem       | that a given ruby gem is installed  
  EOS
  ) %>

  %p And the negative forms:

  <%= table(
  	:headers => ["Type", "Will assure"],
  	:contents => <<-EOS
  FileDoesntExist    | that the given file doesn't exist			     
  SymlinkDoesntExist | that the given symlink doesn't exist            
  ExecutableDoesntExist    | that the given file doesn't exist exist or isn't executable
  DirDoesntExist     | that the given directory doesn't exist           
  ProcessDoesntExist | that the process isn't runnning             
) %>
